1. Install official ``l10n_ve`` and set the company country to Venezuela.
   Official Odoo still links the country to obsolete VEF (symbol Bs.F).
   This module activates **VES** (symbol **Bs**) and uses it as Venezuela's
   currency; companies still on VEF are switched (VEF and VES are the same
   bolívar, 1:1).
   ``territorial_pd`` is required and is installed automatically (states,
   municipalities and parishes from Mastercore 16.0).
   ``l10n_latam_base`` is required and is installed automatically with this
   module (official Odoo 17 addons; do not install it by hand). The partner form then shows
   identification type + number (``vat``): **RIF**, **Cédula Venezolano**,
   **Cédula Extranjera** and **Pasaporte** (Contacts / Configuration /
   Identification Type). Generic LATAM VAT / Foreign ID are archived.
2. Accounting > Configuration > Venezuelan Localization > Tax Units (UT).
3. Review SENIAT URLs if official endpoints change.
4. Set the VES / BCV rate (or install ``currency_rate_update_bcv``);
   posting and withholdings require it.
5. ``person_type`` is under the identification number. A Venezuelan partner
   requires the number; type + letter must match person type (V → PNRE,
   E → PNNR, J/C/G → PJDO, P → PJND). Other partner fiscal data
   (VAT subject, IVA agent) is on the **Accounting** tab, same pattern as 19.0.
6. IVA ``appl_type`` is assigned on install/update (Exento, reducido 8%,
   general 16%, adicional 31%). The company default sale/purchase tax is
   **IVA 16%**. Official ``l10n_ve`` still ships 12% / 22% until
   odoo#285425; those records are aligned in place to 16% / 31%. Mark
   **SDCF** yourself on the 0% taxes that have no tax credit; that cannot
   be inferred from the rate.
7. Optionally mark fiscal printer usage on the company.
8. SENIAT taxpayer type (Ordinary / Formal / Special) is on the partner
   form, under person type. Catalog:
   *Accounting > Configuration > Venezuelan Localization > SENIAT Taxpayer Types*.
9. Venezuelan banks (SUDEBAN code in BIC) are loaded on install. On a
   bank account, choosing a VE bank prefixes the number with the 4-digit
   code if it is empty; set checking / savings / trust as needed.
