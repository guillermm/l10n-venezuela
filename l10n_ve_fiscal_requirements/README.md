Core fiscal module for Odoo 17. Depends on official `l10n_ve` (7-digit codes) and official `l10n_latam_base`. Adds SENIAT control numbers, RIF `V/E/J/P/G/C`, Tax Units (UT 43.00 from 2025-06-02), VES helpers that require an exchange rate, SENIAT partner consultation, tax aliquot classification, SENIAT taxpayer type (Ordinary / Formal / Special), Venezuelan bank catalog (SUDEBAN BIC) and invoice PDF with RIF / control number. Fiscal printer fields are optional (no hardware driver).

## Configuration

1. Install official `l10n_ve` and set the company country to Venezuela. `territorial_pd` (states, municipalities and parishes from Mastercore) and `l10n_latam_base` are installed automatically with this module. The partner form then shows identification type + number (`vat`): RIF, Cédula Venezolano, Cédula Extranjera and Pasaporte.
2. *Accounting -> Configuration -> Venezuelan Localization -> Tax Units (UT)*.
3. Review SENIAT URLs if official endpoints change.
4. Set the VES / BCV rate (or install `currency_rate_update_bcv`); posting and withholdings require it.
5. Optionally mark fiscal printer usage on the company.
6. SENIAT taxpayer type is under person type. Banks (SUDEBAN code in BIC) load on install.

## Usage

When posting customer invoices or vendor bills:
1. Sales: the control number is assigned automatically if empty.
2. Purchases: enter the pre-printed SENIAT control number.
3. A Venezuelan partner cannot be saved without identification number. The type (RIF, cédula, passport) must match the person type (PNRE/PNNR/PJDO/PJND).
4. Invoice total cannot be zero; due date cannot be before the invoice date; credit notes need a source invoice; one aliquot per line.
5. Contacts can be checked via *Accounting -> Customers -> Consult Partner in SENIAT*.
6. Printed invoices show RIF, control number, municipality and parish when the company is Venezuelan.
